    <p>
        Gender Classification: This app is driven by data and machine learning model.
        As soon as user upload an image, it is converted in background into grayscale, crop face,
        resize, flattening and finally using a developed ML model to make a prediction (male or female with the probability).
        All these functionalities are dumped in the flask app.
